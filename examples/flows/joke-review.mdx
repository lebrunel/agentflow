# Joke review!

This is a simple workflow that generates a joke and then reviews it.

---

Generate a hillarious one-liner joke for a family-friendly audience:

<GenText
  as="joke"
  model="ollama:llama3.1"
  />

Now be a comedy critic. Review the joke above and give it an honest score out of 5:

<GenObject
  as="review"
  model="ollama:llama3.1"
  schema={
    $.z.object({
      review: $.z.string().describe('A one sentence review'),
      score: $.z.number().describe('A score between one and five, where 1 is not funny and 5 is side-splittingly hillarious.'),
    })
  } />

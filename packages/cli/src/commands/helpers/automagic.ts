This is an experimental feature and results may vary. A well-written brief is crucial for getting the best results.

Before proceeding:
- See examples of effective briefs at: ${pc.cyan('http://agentflow.2point0.ai/guide/automagic')}
- Customize the model used with the \`${pc.yellow('--automagic-model')}\` option (defaults to \`${pc.yellow('openai:o1')}\`)
- Ensure the automagic model provider is configured in your project's \`${pc.yellow('agentflow.config.js')}\` file
- Note: Generation with \`${pc.yellow('openai:o1')}\` typically costs between $1.00-$5.00, depending on complexity

When you continue, your default text editor will open with a brief template.
Take your time to think through and describe your workflow's requirements.

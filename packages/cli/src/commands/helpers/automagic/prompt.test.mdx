I need you to create an Agentflow workflow based on the following brief. Take your time to analyze the requirements and create a well-structured solution.

## User brief

${USER_BRIEF}

Important implementation guidelines:

1. Structure your workflow properly:
   - Define all required inputs in the frontmatter
   - Break complex processes into logical phases
   - Choose appropriate models for different tasks
   - Remember that `<GenText />` and `<GenObject />` actions use the text BEFORE them as their input
   - Each action's result becomes part of the context for subsequent actions in the same phase

2. Available models: ${AVAILABLE_MODELS}

3. Key validation points:
   - Ensure variable names are unique within their scope
   - Properly pass context between phases using expressions
   - Correctly scope variables in loops and conditions
   - Validate all input requirements

Create your workflow based on the requirements provided in the brief. Make reasonable assumptions where details are not explicitly provided.

AgentFlow is a low-code framework for creating and executing AI-powered workflows using Markdown and natural language.

- 💬 **Natural language as code** - Write powerful workflows using natural language and Markdown, making automation accessible to all.
- 🧠 **AI-powered execution** - Take advantage of cutting-edge AI models to bring super-intelligence to your workflows.
- 🔌 **Flexible and adaptable** - Connect with any AI provider or run models locally, for complete control and flexibility.
- 🔀 **Full logical control** - Create complex workflows with loops and conditional branching, just like traditional programming but in plain English.
- 🛠️ **Extend with ease** - Add custom actions and tools using JavaScript to tailor AgentFlow to your specific needs.

> [!WARNING]
> AgentFlow is in early development. While it's ready for experimentation and early adoption, the API may change as we continue to improve the framework. Always refer to the [documentation](https://agentflow.2point0.ai) for the latest updates.

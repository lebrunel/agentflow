I need you to create an Agentflow workflow based on the following brief. You MUST follow the process exactly as outlined below.

## User brief

${USER_BRIEF}

## Required Process

1. FIRST STEP - Ask Questions:
   - You SHOULD start by using the `ask_user` tool for ANY unclear requirements
   - Do NOT proceed until you have clear answers
   - Example: `ask_user("What specific format should the output follow?")`

2. Once requirements are clear:
   - Define all required inputs in frontmatter
   - Break into logical phases
   - Choose appropriate models from: ${AVAILABLE_MODELS}
   - Available tools: ${AVAILABLE_TOOLS}

3. CRITICAL Structure Rules:
   - `<GenText />` and `<GenObject />` are ALWAYS self-closing
   - ALL prompts go BEFORE their respective actions
   - NEVER put prompt text inside the actions

4. REQUIRED Validation:
   - You MUST use `save_workflow` to validate your solution
   - Fix ANY validation errors and try again
   - Continue until successful validation

❌ INCORRECT structure:
```mdx
<GenText as="summary" model="openai:gpt-4">
  Summarize this article
</GenText>
```

✅ CORRECT structure:
```mdx
Summarize this article

<GenText as="summary" model="openai:gpt-4" />
```

START NOW by asking clarifying questions using the `ask_user` tool. Do NOT proceed without getting clarity on ANY unclear requirements.
